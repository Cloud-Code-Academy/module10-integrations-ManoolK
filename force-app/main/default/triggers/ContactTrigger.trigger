/**
 * ContactTrigger Trigger Description:
 * 
 * The ContactTrigger is designed to handle various logic upon the insertion and update of Contact records in Salesforce. 
 * 
 * Key Behaviors:
 * 1. When a new Contact is inserted and doesn't have a value for the DummyJSON_Id__c field, the trigger generates a random number between 0 and 100 for it.
 * 2. Upon insertion, if the generated or provided DummyJSON_Id__c value is less than or equal to 100, the trigger initiates the getDummyJSONUserFromId API call.
 * 3. If a Contact record is updated and the DummyJSON_Id__c value is greater than 100, the trigger initiates the postCreateDummyJSONUser API call.
 * 
 * Best Practices for Callouts in Triggers:
 * 
 * 1. Avoid Direct Callouts: Triggers do not support direct HTTP callouts. Instead, use asynchronous methods like @future or Queueable to make the callout.
 * 2. Bulkify Logic: Ensure that the trigger logic is bulkified so that it can handle multiple records efficiently without hitting governor limits.
 * 3. Avoid Recursive Triggers: Ensure that the callout logic doesn't result in changes that re-invoke the same trigger, causing a recursive loop.
 * 
 * Optional Challenge: Use a trigger handler class to implement the trigger logic.
